# Plugin-Java

This is a basic example/template for building DroidScript plugins using Android Studio v4+

You can make and install the plugin to your device via ADB by running the 'make-plugin.sh' script in
the AndroidStudio terminal window (after building an APK from the Android Studio menu)

These are the main files of interest:

java/../MyPlugin.java - The main code for the plugin functionality
assets/MyPlugin.inc  - The JavaScript wrapper for the plugin
assets/MyPlugin.html - The active documentation and samples for the plugin


Please search/ask on the DroidScript forum for more information:-
