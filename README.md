# Plugin-Java

This is a basic example/template for building DroidScript plugins using Android Studio v4+

You can make and install the plugin to your device via ADB by running the 'make-plugin.sh' script in
the AndroidStudio terminal window (after building an APK from the Android Studio menu)
    
Please search/ask on the DroidScript forum for more information:-
